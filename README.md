# T-book Web Service API

Our web service API provides users with fast and reliable access to your T-book data. You can use the T-book Web Service API to retrieve and manage T-book content.

## Getting Started

This section describes how to access our Web Service API.

### Prerequisites

First, you need to generate your API credentials : 

* Login to your [T-book client account](https://t-book.fr)
* Go to the API section. If you can't find this section, please [contact us](mailto:alban.miconnet@digitaluniversity.education), we will have to grant you access. 
* There, you will find your client ID, and be able to generate your client secret. **WARNING : you will only be able to see your client secret this one time!** Store precautiously your credentials, they will be needed in any request to the API. You will however be able to regenerate your client secret if needed.
> Note : Your client secret is confidential. Avoid storing it in plain text.
